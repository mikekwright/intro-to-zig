Introduction to Zig (Book Follow)
======================================================

This repository is tracking the work that I am going to complete as I follow
the details of the zig book [Introduction to Zig](https://pedropark99.github.io/zig-book/).

## Setup

This repository uses [nix](https://nixos.org/download/)
[flakes](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Flakes) and [devenv](https://devenv.sh/)
to create a reproducible environment for working with the code.

```bash
# The --no-pure-eval is a devenv requirement
nix develop --no-pure-eval
```
